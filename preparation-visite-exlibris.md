### User management

Chaque utilisateur peut fréquenter n'importe quel bibliothèque quelque soit sont université d'appartenance. Dans chacune des bibliothèques il bénéfice des mêmes droits que dans les établissements de son université d'inscription. 

Every user can use any libraries regardless off his university. In all librairies he has the same rights that would be available in his institution. 

CASE : 00622866

External users were loaded in NZ institution and copied in institution when their barcode were scanned at the circulation desk or when they signed in Primo. Problem. A User from 33PUDB\_UBM institution see a book from 33PUDB\_BXSA via 33PUDB\_UBM primo view. This user sign in but can place a demand on the record because his account is not copied in 33PUDB\_BXSA. 

The patch sf:00622866 supposed to solve this issue but the issue is still there.
